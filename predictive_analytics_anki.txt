Which of the following is NOT a measure of central tendency? A) Mean B) Median C) Range D) Mode E) Trimmed Mean	C) Range - Range measures spread/dispersion, not central tendency. Central tendency measures include Mean, Median, Mode, and Trimmed Mean.

What type of chart is most useful for comparing medians and variability across multiple groups?	Boxplot - Boxplots display the median (center line), quartiles (box edges), and variability (whiskers), making them ideal for comparing distributions across groups.

What is the recommended first step in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before building a predictive model?	Visualize distributions of variables - Before modeling, you should explore your data visually using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to understand patterns and identify potential issues.

The "Lady Tasting Tea" anecdote by R.A. Fisher illustrates which statistical concept?	Hypothesis Testing - Fisher used this experiment to demonstrate the logic of testing a null hypothesis (the lady cannot distinguish tea) against an alternative hypothesis.

What makes an estimator "unbiased"?	An estimator is unbiased when its expected value equals the true population parameter. E(θ̂) = θ

When constructing a 95% confidence interval for a population mean with unknown σ, which formula is correct?	x̄ ± t* · (s/√n) - When σ is unknown, we use the sample standard deviation s and the t-distribution critical value t*.

Which distribution is used when testing a hypothesis about a single population variance?	Chi-square (χ²) distribution - The test statistic (n-1)s²/σ² follows a chi-square distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom.

What type of chart shows proportions that sum to 100% for each category?	100% Stacked Column Chart - Each bar reaches 100%, showing the relative proportions of different components within each category.

For right-skewed data with outliers, which measure of central tendency is most appropriate?	Median - The median is resistant to outliers and skewness, making it more representative of the "typical" value in skewed distributions.

In PCA (Principal Component Analysis), what is true about principal components?	Principal components are orthogonal (uncorrelated) to each other - Each component captures variance in a direction perpendicular to all previous components.

What is a Type I Error in hypothesis testing?	Rejecting H₀ when H₀ is actually true (False Positive) - This is the error of concluding there is an effect when there isn't one.

What is a Type II Error in hypothesis testing?	Failing to reject H₀ when H₀ is actually false (False Negative) - This is the error of missing a real effect.

What does the p-value represent in hypothesis testing?	The probability of observing data as extreme as (or more extreme than) what was observed, assuming H₀ is true.

In SVD decomposition A = UΣVᵀ, what does the Σ matrix represent?	Σ is a diagonal matrix containing singular values that represent the "strength" or importance of each latent factor/concept.

What is the "curse of dimensionality"?	As the number of features/dimensions increases, the amount of data needed to generalize accurately grows exponentially, and distances between points become less meaningful.

In Simple Linear Regression Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε, what assumption is made about ε?	ε ~ N(0, σ) - The errors are normally distributed with mean 0 and constant variance σ².

What is the formula for the standard error of the slope (b₁) in simple linear regression?	SE(b₁) = sₑ / √Σ(xᵢ - x̄)² where sₑ is the residual standard error.

How do you construct a confidence interval for β₁ (population slope)?	b₁ ± t* · SE(b₁) where t* is the critical value from t-distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom.

What should residual plots look like if regression assumptions are satisfied?	Residuals should show: 1) No pattern (random scatter) for linearity, 2) Constant spread for homoscedasticity, 3) Approximately normal distribution.

What is a "leverage point" in regression?	A point with an extreme x-value (far from x̄) that has high potential to influence the regression line.

What is the difference between an outlier and an influential point?	An outlier has an unusual y-value; an influential point actually changes the regression results substantially when removed.

In the Lady Tasting Tea experiment, what is the probability calculation C(8,4)?	C(8,4) = 70 - This represents the number of ways to choose 4 cups from 8 cups total.

What does α (alpha) represent in hypothesis testing?	α is the significance level - the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting H₀ when it's true). Common values are 0.05 or 0.01.

What is the relationship between confidence level and α?	Confidence Level = 1 - α. A 95% confidence level corresponds to α = 0.05.

Why do we use the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution for small samples?	The t-distribution accounts for additional uncertainty from estimating σ with s. It has heavier tails than the normal distribution, especially for small n.

What happens to the t-distribution as sample size increases?	As n → ∞, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal (z) distribution.

In PCA, what is the goal of the first principal component?	To capture the maximum possible variance in the data - it points in the direction of greatest variability.

How much variance does each subsequent principal component capture?	Each subsequent PC captures the maximum remaining variance while being orthogonal to all previous PCs.

What is the null hypothesis (H₀) typically representing?	H₀ represents the "status quo" or "no effect" - it's the claim we're trying to find evidence against.

What is the alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)?	H₁ is what we're trying to find evidence FOR - it represents a new claim or the presence of an effect.

When do we reject the null hypothesis?	When p-value < α (significance level), we reject H₀ because the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis.

What does "failing to reject H₀" mean?	We don't have sufficient evidence to conclude H₁ is true. It does NOT mean H₀ is proven true.

What is the coefficient of determination (R²) in regression?	R² represents the proportion of variance in Y that is explained by the regression model. Values range from 0 to 1.

What is a histogram best used for?	Visualizing the distribution (shape, center, spread) of a single continuous variable.

What is a scatter plot best used for?	Visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables and identifying patterns, trends, or correlations.

In regression, what does the intercept (β₀) represent?	The expected value of Y when X = 0. (Note: interpretation may not be meaningful if X=0 is outside the data range)

In regression, what does the slope (β₁) represent?	The expected change in Y for a one-unit increase in X.

What are the conditions/assumptions for simple linear regression?	1) Linearity 2) Independence of errors 3) Normality of errors 4) Equal variance (homoscedasticity)

How do you check the normality assumption in regression?	Use a Normal Q-Q plot of residuals - points should fall approximately along a straight diagonal line.

How do you check the constant variance assumption?	Plot residuals vs. fitted values - the spread of residuals should be roughly constant across all fitted values (no funnel shape).

What is multicollinearity?	When predictor variables in multiple regression are highly correlated with each other, making it difficult to isolate individual effects.

What is the purpose of dimensionality reduction?	To reduce the number of features/variables while retaining most of the important information, helping with visualization, computation, and avoiding overfitting.

In the SVD equation A = UΣVᵀ for a user-movie matrix, what does U represent?	U is the user-to-concept similarity matrix - it shows how each user relates to the latent factors/concepts.

In the SVD equation A = UΣVᵀ for a user-movie matrix, what does V represent?	V is the movie-to-concept similarity matrix - it shows how each movie relates to the latent factors/concepts.

What is the difference between population parameters and sample statistics?	Parameters (μ, σ, β) describe the true population; Statistics (x̄, s, b) are estimates calculated from sample data.

Why is sample standard deviation calculated with n-1 in the denominator?	Using n-1 (Bessel's correction) makes s² an unbiased estimator of σ². Dividing by n would systematically underestimate variance.

What is a confidence interval?	A range of plausible values for a population parameter, constructed so that in repeated sampling, a specified percentage of intervals would contain the true parameter.

Does a 95% CI mean there's a 95% probability the parameter is in the interval?	No - the parameter is fixed. 95% refers to the long-run success rate of the method: 95% of similarly constructed intervals would contain the true parameter.

What determines the width of a confidence interval?	Sample size (larger n = narrower), confidence level (higher = wider), and variability in data (more variability = wider).

What is the Central Limit Theorem?	For large samples, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution.

How large should n be for CLT to apply?	Generally n ≥ 30 is sufficient, though this depends on how skewed the population is. More skewed = larger n needed.

What is statistical power?	The probability of correctly rejecting H₀ when H₁ is true (1 - β, where β is Type II error rate).

How can you increase statistical power?	Increase sample size, increase α, decrease variability, or increase effect size.
